# IDA-Hackathon
We were tasked with optimizing a simulated manufacturing line for Mercedes Benz using pseudo-data from the past 90 days. Our approach was a gradient descent algorithm with a randomized neighbor optimization after to escape relative minimums. More in depth information on our approach can be found in the presentation file.
